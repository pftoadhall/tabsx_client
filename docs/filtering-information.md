# Where is filtering available?
Filtering is available on any endpoint which has the 'filter' property on the initial json node.

## Filtering format
Within the GET request to the endpoints specified above you may pass the `filter` query parameter.  This may either be as a string or an array of strings.  Filters are passed within this parameter as a key/value store with the equals `=` character separating the key and value. Multiple filters must be separated with a colon character `:`.  If multiple filters are applied, the search effect will be multiplicative (i.e. this equals that AND this equals that).  

When an array of filters is applied, the search effect will be additive (i.e. this equals that AND this equals that OR this equals that).

For example:

|Filter        |Filter effect|
|--------------|-------------|
|http://apiroot/v2/property?filter=param1=1|Filters with parameter1 with the value of 1|
|http://apiroot/v2/property?filter[]=param1=1|Same as above|
|http://apiroot/v2/property?filter=param1=1:param2=2|Filters with parameter1 with the value of 1 **AND** parameter2 with the value of 2|
|http://apiroot/v2/property?filter[]=param1=1:param2=2&filter[]=value3=1|Same as above **OR** with parameter3 with the value of 1|

### Operands
With each filter, certain operands are available which will change your filters behavior.  The following operands are supported:

|Operands|Filter format|Behavior|
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
|=||Equals operator.  This is the default behavior and you do not need to additionally specify it|
|>|filter=param1=>1|Greater than **or equal to** operator.  For any integer fields, you may search for fields greater than or equal to your specified value.|
|<|filter=param1=<1|Less than **or equal to** operator.  For any integer fields, you may search for fields less than or equal to your specified value.|
|/|filter=param1=1/3|Between operand.  For any integer fields, you may search for fields which match between  your two specified parameters.|
|~|filter=param2=~Cottage|Like operator.  For any string fields, you may search for fields which are like your specified parameter.  This will be a wildcard match.|
|&#124;|filter=param3=1&#124;2&#124;3 |OR operator.  You may search for fields which equal the any of the parameters that you specify between the pipe character &#124;.|
|*|filter=param3=*abc|Starts with operator.  You may search for fields which start with the specified characters.|

### How do I filter with the php client?
You can find an example of how to [filter properties here](property/filtering.html).
