# Example of receiving a webhook notification
This file documents how to read the web hook responses from tabs2.

```php

$snsFullMessage = \tabs\apiclient\WebHook::detectRequestBody();
if ($snsFullMessage && isset($snsFullMessage['SubscribeURL'])) {
    // Send the response back to the web hook request to say its been accepted.
    echo file_get_contents($snsFullMessage['SubscribeURL']);
    die();
} else if (is_array($snsFullMessage)) {
    // Do something with the response
    error_log(print_r(json_decode($snsFullMessage['Message']), true));
}

```
